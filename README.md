## Our Personalized Planner Application
Nathan Lee, Derrick Choy, Kevin Mach

Our team will be creating a planner application. The difference between our and other calendar interfaces is that we will be aiming to make it extremely personalized to user needs/goals. Due to the lack of time and lack of $$ we will be assuming that it our interface is personalized to one of our team members and we will add usability and flexibility for all users as time allows.
